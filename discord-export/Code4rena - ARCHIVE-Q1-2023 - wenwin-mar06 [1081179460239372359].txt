it is an example. Ticket price is immutable after contract deployment. In the first lottery, 7 of 35 ticket price will be 1.5 DAI

The winning number is always a 7 Digit number correct?


[03/06/2023 21:28] rando#9476

reconstructTicket makes sure it is like that. We also do a fuzzing on this method to return valid ticket.

[03/07/2023 06:38] y1cunhui
Sorry, so the "Tickets Sold = 1,000,000" means the number of tickets instead of the money.


[03/07/2023 06:39] y1cunhui
I misunderstand that


[03/07/2023 06:43] seyni#0562
1.5 is the cost per ticket. 1.5 is for 1.5 DAI


[03/07/2023 07:29] TutaRicky#4738
There is no specific area in code that we are worried about(the "hardest" part in code is reward calculations, so maybe that would be an area where you could look if we missed something)

Hi Rando, I added you as a friend for DMs, if you could please accept.


[03/07/2023 07:38] TutaRicky#4738
Frontend operators will directly connect to our SDK (or if they want, they could connect directly to smart contracts), but there is no specific integration from the backend side. The only `integration` is that in the function `buyTickets`, as parameter `frontend` will send the address of the frontend operator.


[03/07/2023 07:39] TutaRicky#4738
Accepted


[03/07/2023 07:52] TutaRicky#4738
As @seyni answered, 1.5 is ticket cost (1.5 DAI), and in this scenario (example), we projected 1 million tickets sold (so that is 1.5 million DAI).

The project heavily relies on public state variables, which by specifying override, actually override the functions in the interface. It is not a very common practice I think and confusing at first, but ends up with a lot less code and is pretty neat

[03/07/2023 08:57] dingo2077
Hi, few questions:
1) In our base scenario(for example in docs) selectionMax = 35? selectionSize = 7?
2) How they packed into uint120? Like 7284920? What if I want choose 12 and 13 and 1. It will packed 12131? If so, how will you know that this is not 1,21,31 ?

1. Yes, but the code is not limited only to that lottery variant
2. 1st, 12th and 13th rightmost bits are set to 1. So `ticket = (1 << 0) | (1 << 11) | (1 << 12)`

What's the difference between drawIds and tickets in the buyTickets function?


[03/07/2023 09:15] dingo2077
tickets are choosed numbers. drawIds is the wednesday Id xD

[03/07/2023 09:17] 0xpathfindr
```   if (drawIds.length != tickets.length) { 
            revert DrawsAndTicketsLenMismatch(drawIds.length, tickets.length);
        }``` 


Why does the drawIds.length  have to match  tickets.length?


[03/07/2023 09:18] 0xpathfindr
I'm guessing 1 draw == 1 ticket


[03/07/2023 09:19] 0xpathfindr
So I draw can be = [123456]  which is [1 ]ticket


[03/07/2023 09:24] bole2653
If you look at the code the following snippet you provided, this is required because it creates ticket NFT for the respective element in drawID and ticket arrays retrieved by common index, therefore they must match

ith ticket will be bought for ith draw


[03/07/2023 09:40] rando#9476
1) yes
2) I will try to answer with binary representation that you asked. "...1100000000001" would represent selecting 1, 12, and 13, without selecting any of the numbers between. So if number X is selected,  (X-1)th rightmost bit is set to 1. Since we limit lottery to 120 selection maximum you need only uint120 as it has 120 bits.
in the case od 7/35, we basically use only 35 rightmost bits. Hope this explains

what is the connection between `Staking.sol` and `StakedTokenLocked.sol`?


[03/07/2023 11:42] igingu
Thank you! So the structure should be: name, code links, description, PoC, impact, and Recommended Mitigation Steps? Also, what do wardens write the reports in? (is it markdown), and do the code blocks need to look colorful in the reports?


[03/07/2023 11:45] chrisapostolov
Where can I read more about the safety margin implemented?


[03/07/2023 11:46] 0xluckydev#5064
`StakedTokenLocked.sol` is used for the team's staked tokens and `Staking.sol` is the staked token itself


[03/07/2023 11:46] 0xluckydev#5064
So `StakedTokenLocked` uses `Staking`


[03/07/2023 11:47] Rvi#5470
so teams token only gets locked?


[03/07/2023 11:47] kenzoagada
Yes, if you check out the submission like Ricky linked to, you'll see there's already a guiding template.
The reports are in GitHub markdown as they will show up on GH eventually.
I think you can wrap your code in 3 times "`" and then "solidity" and end it with 3 times that quote I used earlier.

Such questions are better in a general channel like #🐺wardens , this channel is more for things directly related to this codebase

To clarify prev topic about buyTicket().
If I want to choose 1,13,12,7. - which uint120 should I pass to func? Help anyone plz). If 7 out of 35 condition.
btw another question. IF 7 out of 35, seems I coud use less (like 3 numbers), right?


[03/07/2023 17:22] madalad
1,13,12,7 means you choose uint120(0x1100001000001) if I understood correctly


[03/07/2023 17:23] 0xdaef0f
That is a good question. How `uint120` map to a sequence of numbers.


[03/07/2023 17:27] dingo2077
are you sure? you use hex + binary )


[03/07/2023 17:28] dingo2077
Just for info: in provided tests. `SELECTION_SIZE` = 4;  `SELECTION_MAX `= 10;
User pick (buyTicket) = uint120(0x0F). wat? obv it is not 15, bcz out fo range


[03/07/2023 17:39] dingo2077
what if 13 already has `1` bit rightmosted?


[03/07/2023 17:40] 0xluckydev#5064
This is right representation of those for numbers if it is binary (0b1100001000001), not hex. So, if you have a 7/35 lottery and numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, binary representation would be 0...01111111 (0x7F in hex)

[03/07/2023 17:43] 0xluckydev#5064
Here's one python code you can run to check the binary representation:
```python
numbers = [1, 5, 14, 15, 20, 22, 35]
ticket = 0
for i in numbers:
    ticket |= 1 << (i - 1)  # same as ticket += 2 ** (i - 1)

print(bin(ticket)) # binary representation
print(hex(ticket)) # hex representation
```

Is there a maximum number of tickets that can be bought for a particular lottery >


[03/07/2023 18:16] igingu
You can think of it like this: let's say you run 7 / 35, and you picked 1 3 5 10 11 15 29. The representation of your ticket, in the smart contract is JUST ONE NUMBER, NOT 7. That number will be 2 ^ 1 + 2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 5 + 2 ^ 10 + 2 ^ 11 + 2 ^ 15 + 2 ^ 29 (which is, a number where bits 1 3 5 10 11 15 29 are set to 1)

This way, picking 1 3 5 or 5 3 1 ends up with the same ticket: 000.....0000101010.

I think the gap in your understanding is that you are trying to convert picked number X into binary, and do something with it. How it actually works is that picking number X makes the representation of your ticket(in binary) have a 1 on position X, instead of a 0

Now, if I have a ticket representation in binary, the way to convert it back to my 7 numbers is to see what are the indices of the bits set to 1. Let's call them X1, X2, ..., X7. The rest of the bits should be 0. This ticket would then mean that I picked numbers X1, X2, ..., X7

{Reactions}
🔥 (9) ✅ hi5 

[03/07/2023 18:38] 0xluckydev#5064
This is almost correct, except that correct formula is 2 ^ (X1 - 1) + 2 ^ (X2 - 1) + 2 ^ (X3 - 1) + 2 ^ (X4 - 1) + 2 ^ (X5 - 1) + 2 ^ (X6 - 1) + 2 ^ (X7 - 1) if you pick numbers X1, ..., X7 (each number is >= 1 and <= 35 for 7/35 lottery)

The idea is not to look at this project as 7/35 only, but any possible combination. Selection size can be up to 16, selection max up to 120 and you can have min win tier 1


[03/07/2023 18:45] 0xluckydev#5064
You can see in the code that we didn't hardcode any of those parameters as they're set during deployment and can have any valid value

[03/07/2023 19:36] 0xluckydev#5064

[03/07/2023 20:19] Rvi#5470
Dm pls


[03/07/2023 20:26] descharre
Why is this? I thought other projects would just use the same contract with the 7/35 example on their frontend.


[03/07/2023 20:32] 0xluckydev#5064
We didn't want to limit ourselves by sticking to 7/35 only. Even if we hardcoded 7/35, the constants would be `SELECTION_SIZE = 7` and `SELECTION_MAX = 35` which are effectively same as immutable variables we have now. We use 7/35 (with min winnable tier of 3) as an example, but the contract should work for any other valid lottery.

To sum up one use case, if we want to run multiple instances with different parameters, we can do it just by changing `.env` file without ever touching the contact code. All instances will have the same code, but different initial parameters. Hope that answers your question

`drawCoolDownPeriod` will probably be 30 minutes, `firstDrawSchedule` any time in the future, and `drawPeriod` will be 7 days. But this does not so matter, because, as @Lucky Dev wrote, we could deploy some other lottery, where all that parameters could be totally different.

`expectedPayout` is our fixed calculation about expected payout that depends on number of combinations for minimum rewards, `selectionSize`, `selectionMax` and of course, decimals for reward calculations. Formula is something like this (for 7/35, where first prize is for 3/7)
```
prizePerTier = {
   3: $1.5,
   4: $5,
   5: $75,
   6: $1500
}
expectedPayout = 0;
for (x = 3; x < 7; x++) {
    expectedPayout += prizePerTier[x] * (f(7,x) * f(35 - 7, 7-x) / f(35, 7))
}
```


[03/08/2023 08:17] 0xluckydev#5064
Yes you can claim up to 1 year from ticket's draw. After that, unclaimed jackpots are returned to the pot and non-jackpot ones are just lost. I'm sorry but I don't understand your second question

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/08/2023 08:18] TutaRicky#4738
I think that in code is pretty good explained - `Reconstructs ticket from random number. Each number is selected from appropriate 8 bits from random number. In each iteration, we calculate the modulo of a random number and then shift it for 8 bits to the right. The modulo is used to select one number from the numbers that are not already selected.`. So, `reconstructTicket` will return winning ticket combination.


[03/08/2023 08:27] 0xluckydev#5064
I suggest you running the function manually in isolation or trying to do it on paper with some smaller numbers too

One question. If I am not mistaken in the docs it says that one can buy multiple tickets per draw. But looking at the buyTickets functions we can see that only a ticket per draw can be bought


[03/08/2023 10:59] TutaRicky#4738

Sorry I’m horrible when thinking out loud. I kinda formed 3 questions in one. I’m trying to get a good overview of the process the ticket goes through after mint.

You are free to do so, but you must have min ticket sold to get any economic incentive. If you buy that many tickets, you deserve to get "cashback." Most of players will buy tickets through frontends, so we don't have any issues with self-referring

[03/08/2023 15:13] rando#9476
Very good question, thanks for asking. There are few reasons:
1. We want referrer to be able to claim reward as soon as possible
2. If user buys ticket for `currentDraw + 5`, we do not know minimal requirement for referrer to be able to claim as the calculation depends on `currentDraw + 4`. So, if user sells enough tickets for `currentDraw + 5` and he doesn't sell a single ticket after we get minimal requirement, total tickets that are eligable for rewards per draw will be wrong, and calculations broken. You can take a look at this line https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin/blob/main/src/ReferralSystem.sol#L64

This is why we decided to give rewards for tickets sold during particular draw, and not the draw ticket was bought for.

Hope this is helpful

Issues with calculations make it hard to know what to return 
I asked this question privately this was a response from the team. 


```
That's why expectedPayout exists, since we won't be able to calculate number of all non-jackpot winners throughout win tiers (in case of 7/35, from 3 to 6 matches), thus we won't know how much we need to return to the pot.
Users have generous 52 draws to claim their winnings and we assume that all of them would do it (or at least, that's what expectedPayout covers on conservative average). If we wanted to introduce off-chain calculation of number of non-jackpot winners, it would introduce centralization in the protocol that is aiming for decentralized, uninterrupted and error prone lottery.
Here's the explanation why
After one year, that funds would be either implicitly locked (wasted) by users (they ever forget to claim) or by the protocol
0xluckydev — Today at 09:31
But, the tokens won't be really locked, as they would be used for paying upcoming prizes anyway which would even make the protocol less insolvent
If you think of the protocol as one big pot, only portion of the pot is allocated for rewards, but any token from the pot can be used for payment, even ones that are "reserved" for rewards

I'm having a hard time grasping what `expectedPayout` should be.


[03/08/2023 21:41] patrickalphac
What does `380000000000000000` mean? It means for 1 ticket sold the expected payout is `0.38` DAI? I don't understand that.

Is this supposed to be expected value of buying 1 ticket? 

ie: If I buy 1 ticket @ 1.50 DAI, I should expect a 0.38 DAI return on investment?

the code in `playerRewardsPerDraw` also seems express this properly.

What is the goal of drawCoolDownPeriod ? in LotterySetup


[03/09/2023 08:35] 0xluckydev#5064
A short period of time before a draw when you cannot buy tickets

👍🏼 

[03/09/2023 09:31] elku.cryptos
is there a reason why its there? I mean anyway users cant buy for past draws.


[03/09/2023 09:36] 0xpathfindr
I think it is to ensure that you cannot buy a ticket while a draw is being executed


[03/09/2023 09:46] rando#9476
you cannot buy tickets for past draws


[03/09/2023 09:47] rando#9476
if deployer wants to allow buying tickets until the actual draw, he can set coolDownPeriod to some really small value


[03/09/2023 09:47] rando#9476
however, we will use ~5min for the 1 week draw period


[03/09/2023 09:54] 0xluckydev#5064
Look at it as a business decision for handling ticket buying

The `stakingRewardRecipient` is the creator the lottery correct?


[03/09/2023 11:32] 0xpathfindr
Or rather, the lottery itself ?


[03/09/2023 11:49] 0xluckydev#5064
No, check the code:
```
    constructor(
        LotterySetupParams memory lotterySetupParams,
        uint256 playerRewardFirstDraw,
        uint256 playerRewardDecreasePerDraw,
        uint256[] memory rewardsToReferrersPerDraw,
        uint256 maxRNFailedAttempts,
        uint256 maxRNRequestDelay
    )
        Ticket()
        LotterySetup(lotterySetupParams)
        ReferralSystem(playerRewardFirstDraw, playerRewardDecreasePerDraw, rewardsToReferrersPerDraw)
        RNSourceController(maxRNFailedAttempts, maxRNRequestDelay)
    {
        stakingRewardRecipient = address(
            new Staking(
            this,

Is the winning number is pulled from one draw?
For exmaple, if its a 7/35 contest will there be 7 draws 1 number each draw? or 1 draw with all 7 numbers in that draw


[03/09/2023 15:59] 0xluckydev#5064
1 draw picks all 7 numbers

Hi,
sorry to bother all, 
Is it possible to ask dear judge about the issue 487?
It was selected as a primary issue and then marked as unsatisfactory.
I'd be appreciated if you could explain the reason behind it. 🙏🌹


[04/12/2023 23:05] dadekuma
Hi, I have a question about my issue @cccz : https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin-findings/issues/226

Reorgs attacks are very possible on Polygon, and as the potential payout is very high they might be interested in doing so to improve their chance of winning.

These issues are usually classified as medium (e.g RabbitHole contest: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-rabbithole#m-01-questfactory-is-suspicious-of-the-reorg-attack) so I was wondering what was the reasoning behind the downgrade to low. Thank you!


[04/13/2023 02:25] hellocccz
This is because 487 is considered to be a duplicate of 478, and 478 is considered invalid for the reasons described in

Some transactions submitted with insufficient gas are still considered successful because of the try{} catch{} block therefore you could manipulate the gasPrice

You would be suppressing the callbacks from Chainlink, but that’s an edge case if there is some deployment of a lottery with very short time between draws, the main issue is that retry() and swapSource() could be called at the same time which goes against chainlink security considerations of not re-requesting randomness


[04/13/2023 09:40] 0xjuntao
yes you are right that we are suprressing chainlink callbacks, my understanding of supressing is to raise the average gas price of transactions (by submitting useless transactions with high gas price), so transactions with lower gas price will be excluded


[04/13/2023 09:41] 0xjuntao
if my understanding is correct, the callback transactions should be with different gas price, so one of them could be excluded, even so,  there is still only 1/2 chance that attacker can supress the callback he doesn't prefer


[04/13/2023 09:42] alexxander
With regard to m2 - here you can see two calls to executeDraw() that both revert with out-of-gas, however one of them has enough gasLimit to finish execution of the catch{} clause and is a successful tx

besides,  if it retry and swapSource being called twice  goes against chainlink security consideration, what's the impact on the protocol itself?


[04/13/2023 09:45] alexxander
The fairness is undermined since you are requesting 2 random numbers at the same time


[04/13/2023 09:51] 0xjuntao
hmm makes sense

thank you👍

@cccz 
Could you tell me the reason why this(https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin-findings/issues/16) has been rejected?


[04/13/2023 13:17] hellocccz
When judging GAS reports, I give each valid item 1 score, and good formatting and description ( like describing the amount of gas saved) are given extra scores. Then, grades of a, b, and c are assigned based on the total score.
In wenwin's judgment, gas reports with less than 4 scores are assigned grade c.


[04/13/2023 13:22] chaindev
Ah, no worries
I've already got reward $925 from this contest
The reason is not for a reward
I just thought that that submission is a creative idea and should be listed in the final report
What a beautiful method in bit operation


[04/13/2023 13:33] hellocccz
Congratulations, and also, after reading the report again, I think it deserves extra scores, but I'm sorry I didn't review it in more detail during the judging


[04/13/2023 13:36] chaindev
No problem at all
I just hope that point will be implemented while mitigation
Thanks for your checking

What does grade-c mean?


[04/14/2023 05:20] c3phas.
Not satisfactory,the report was of low quality thus no reward

captain, how do you produce those trace/callstack? is that in foundry?

Ahh ya that one was mine. Still a little unsure how it was invalid but it was cool being the primary submission lol 😄

#478 says that when the random number is too low, the numbers will be all or partly 0.
But in actuality, as stated in https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin-findings/issues/475#issuecomment-1464877286, numbers will be cycled within a range based on the random number, to make the lottery fair distribution.
Consider selectionSize = 3 and selectionMax = 4
when the random number is 0, the numbers is [0,0,0]
when the random number is 24, the numbers is [0,0,0]
When the random number is 24576, the numbers is still [0,0,0]

numbers will cycle within the 24(4 * 3 * 2 * 1) possibilities


[04/15/2023 05:23] kiki_dev
My bad I meant 475 was mine. Thanks for the explanation! I need to get better at POC’s to flush out these false positives. Even looking back at my submission the math seems sound to me. But the sponsors explanation makes sense and with a better poc I would have came to the same conclusion. Bummed though, I was really looking forward to sharing this finding lol

Can anyone help me understand why https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-03-wenwin/#m-04-possibility-to-steal-jackpot-bypassing-restrictions-in-the-executedraw is valid?
My understanding is that the exploit assumes that an attacker executesDraw and then buys the winning ticket. The only way this would be possible is if the two would happen in the same block. However, executeDraw requests a random number from Chainlink VRF, which implies emitting an off-chain event after the block was confirmed, which implies the random number comes on-chain at a later block, a block where buyTickets would no longer work.

The PoC showcased assumes that executeDraw and winningNumber coming back would happen in the same block, but how can that be possible, if ChainlinkVRF needs a block to be confirmed in order to pick the event from off-chain, generate a random number and then submit it? It seems like requesting and receiving random numbers are things that are impossible to happen in the same block

@cccz @dingo2077 maybe I am missing something here? Thank you!

Why was this submission marked as unsatisfactory? https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin-findings/issues/70
Was it that the probability was not high enough for this to be a concern, or should I have created a more detailed report?

Hi mate, good question. This is valid because:
1) chainlink not hardcoded as one oracle.
2) there is option (appropriate func) to change oracle, even for onchain.
If there was possible to make this deal with chainlink it would be high.


[04/20/2023 10:28] igingu
I see, thanks @dingo2077 !
